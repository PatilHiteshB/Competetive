SuperIncreasing Sequence

You are given an array of numbers. Determine if the array forms a superincreasing sequence where each element in the array is greater than the sum of all previous elements. The array will only consist of positive integers. For example: if array is [1, 3, 6, 13, 54] then your program should print "true" because it forms a superincreasing sequence. If a superincreasing sequence isn't formed, then your program should print "false".

Input format:

    First line contains the an integer N, denoting length of array.
    Second line contains space seperated N integers.

Example

    Input: 4 1 2 3 4
    Output: false

    input: 4 1 2 4 10
    Output: true
