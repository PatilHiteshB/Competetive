**Moving Apples**

There are N number of baskets, where i'th basket contains input2[i] apples.

We want to move apples between baskets so that all the baskets have the same number of apples. What is the minimum number of apples that must be moved?

Is is guaranteed that there exists a way to move apples so as have an equal number of apples in each basket.

Input Specifications:
    input1: N, denoting the number of Baskets.
    input2: array representing the number of apples in the Basket.

Output Specifications:
    Return the minimum number of apples that must be moved so that all the baskets have the same number of apples.

Example 1:

    input1: 2
    input2: (1, 3)

    Output: 1

Explanation:

    There are 2 baskets with first containing 1 apple & second containing 3 apples.
    If we shift one apple from the second container to the first container then both will have 2 apples.
    So only one apple was required to move. Hence the output is 1.
