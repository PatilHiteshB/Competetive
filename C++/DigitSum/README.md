**Digit Sum Of An Array**

Today Ankush's maths professor decides to test his maths skill as Ankushis really good with maths. Ankush's professor decides to give him and array of numbers and ask him to find the digit sum of the array.

Digit sum should be a single digit, means you will have to keep adding the digits untill you didn't get the single digit sum.

As Ankush is busy in preparation of certain coding competetion, he asks you for the help. Now it's your task to find the answer.

INPUT FORMAT:

    First line of input will contain the number of testcases(T)
    Each of the first line of every test case contains the size of the array(N)
    Each of the second line of every test case consist of an array of size N.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

    For each test case print the digit sum of the sum of array.

CONSTRAINTS:

    1 < T <= 1000
    1 <= N <= 10000
    1 <= ARR[i] <= 10^12


SAMPLE INPUT 1:

    1
    5
    3 2 9 7 6

SAMPLE OUTPUT 1:

    9

EXPLANATION:

    For test case 1 the sum of the array is 27 & digit sum is 9.

SAMPLE INPUT 2:

    1
    5
    13 22 96 17 26

SAMPLE OUTPUT 2:

    3

EXPLANATION:

    For test case 2 the sum of the array is 174 & digit sum is 12, which has digit sum 3.
